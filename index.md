## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 01 & 02 

    These labs being my very first projects in college allowed me to get an easy insight into the course and helped to slowly guide me into the semester. I also met my first lab partner where I was able to learn how pair programming works as well as working with a team.

* Lab 06, part 2
 
    I remember watching the video in our lecture modules on how to play Black Jack before this lab and was fairly excited to make a program on it. I think being able to code projects that are engaging, as well as not only teaching us how to code, but something else as well is fairly cool. Learning how black jack works while also trying to code the actual game was enjoyable practice. 

* Lab 09, part 1

    This lab was very enjoyable as well as difficult when using different for loops as well as if statements to find the different averages. It took a while to brainstorm different ideas, but also very fun to code and learn in order to better my programming skills. Overall, one of my favorite programs that allowed me to think.
